# Giselle Playground [Experimental]

**[IMPORTANT]** This is an experimental playground. Use at your own risk.

## Getting Started

2. Add your API keys to the `.env.local` file. At least one API key is required, others are optional.

    ```.env
    # Required (at least one of these)

    # Optional
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY"
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

4. Start the development server

    ```sh
    pnpm turbo dev
    ```
